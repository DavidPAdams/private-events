# Private Events

This project is another in the series for the Rails module of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The point of this project is to work with ActiveRecord associations.

## Objective

Build a private app similar to [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows the user to create events. The point is to use the power of ActiveRecord associations to keep track of users as hosts and as guests, events that have a host and invited guests, and invitations for invited guests to events.

This app is not ready to be deployed. I may come back to it to do more...

Continued work or enhancements, (besides styling), include:
  1. Managing guest list on an event (pending/accepted/declined)
  2. Invitations within the system (sending/receiving/accepting/declining)
  3. Further refinement and/or corrections to information displayed
  4. The app has potential for more
