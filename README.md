# Private Events

This project is another in the series for the Rails module of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The point of this project is to work with ActiveRecord associations.

## Objective

Build a private app similar to [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows the user to create events, 
and manage user sign ups as guests of the event. The point is to use the power of ActiveRecord 
associations to keep track of users as hosts and as guests, events that have a host and invited 
guests, and invitations for invited guests to events.
